### Overview

> During the Covid-19 crisis, people have been forced into isolation for many months. With the lock-down measures now relaxing, it is as important as ever for us to get out of the house and allow socialising to resume in a responsible manner.

---

### Description

> The Explore Ireland Project is dedicated to providing a free platform for all interested in road trips, exploring and camping to join us on breath-taking drives around the Irish countryside. Our trips are expertly planned and researched to ensure a safe, enjoyable and healthy experience.

---

#### User Stories

> - _"I don't have a PC or Laptop at home and generally do all my online searches on my mobile"_
> - _"I want to be able to subscribe to a mailing list about upcoming trips"_
> - _"I want to get in touch immediately as I have some recommendations on future routes"_
> - _"I want to be able to join a community forum or social media group to see up to date info on trips"_
> - _"We are keen to get involved but would love to see visual examples of past trips to give us an idea of what to expect"_

---

### UX

This website project will target a large demographic of individuals and families from all walks of life, hence an overall simple, yet effective website is aimed at. The priority focus is on direct contact and social media links.

---

#### 1. Strategy

> The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community engagement, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and leading users to contact via email and/or join our Facebook community Page.
>
> ##### Project Goals:
>
> - Raising awareness on the important connecting and appreciating our environment.
>
> - Building on community awareness of the natural beauty that Ireland has to offer.
>
> - Growing member database via email and direction to Facebook Group interactivity.
>
> ##### Customer Goals:
>
> - Designed site with Mobile-first approach
> - Easy-to-read info. Long enough to understand the content, yet short enough not to overwhelm.
> - Imagery used for intuitive explanation of trips and showing inviting scenery.
> - Contact form with radio button options to narrow down user interest type.
> - Easy reference to Social Media from anywhere on the site.
> - Strong contrasting Social Media icons in the footer.
> - Fixed navigation bar providing user easy navigation reference.
> - Fixed footer providing quick reference to Social Media links.

#### 2. Scope

> I've decided on an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach, which:
>
> - Provides a clean UX for users.
> - Fits in with my current skill-set.
> - Quickly defines the content and focus on getting in touch via email or social media.
> - I've included some **basic** animations to subtly enhance the overall experience.

#### 3. Structure

> The main focus of the structure is to allow Users to quickly assimilate the information and imagery. 
> Short, focussed paragraphs of content information to provide enough information, yet not overwhelm.
> A selection of quality images to provide a taste of the trips and options offered.
> Points of contact are provided via email contact form and links to Social Media in Footer.

#### 4. Skeleton

> - [Wireframes](assets/docs/wireframes.pdf): One-page website with **4** main sections
>
> - Home, About (Trips), Gallery and Contact Section/Pages
>
> - Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 4 pages.
>
> - Fixed Footer with Copyright info and Social Media icons

---

#### 5. Surface

I've decided on a relaxed, yet exciting visual experience reflecting nature and peacefulness coupled with exhilaration of more extreme 4x4 routes and breath-taking views.

> ###### Colours
>
> Neutral earth-tones, reflecting the environment, inviting the User 'outdoors'. 
> - I've chosen 2 primary greens for backgrounds (#eef4db) and headings (#425012). 
> - For body text, I've used a combination of a dark grey (#242424) and off-white (#fafafa), maintaining strong, balanced contrasts.
> 
> ###### Typography
>
> - "Varela Round" font (with fall-back font of Verdana) for main headings. This font was specifically chosen for its rounded edges, which relate to natural curves in nature.
> - "Cabin" font (with fall-back font of Sans-Serif) for body content.
>
> ###### Images
>
> The image selection has been carefully chosen to depict both relaxed road trips for beginners (to instil confidence in taking part as a newcomer); and more extreme 4x4 experiences for the advanced, familiar user.

---

### Testing

> - After initial wireframe design, I checked each navigation item link is working correctly to each Page. I set a _temporary_ contrasting background colour to each page to mark out each section.
> - Tested responsiveness of the wireframe using Dev Tools and confirmed basic structure looks and works well on all mobile decides from 320px, up to desktop size.
> - Tested **Logo text** in menu bar to ensure it points to the Home page.
> - Tested **About, Gallery and Contact** links in menu bar to ensure it points to each page and position correctly.
> - Tested **Social Media icons** in Footer to ensure they open the correct pages, and in a new tab on the browser.
> - Tested **Contact Us** link on About page and ensured that it points to the Contact page on hte same site. 
> - Tested **Facebook Community Group** link on About page to ensure they open the correct page, and in a new tab on the browser.
> - Tested **Carousel right and left arrows** and the right arrow moves to the next image and left arrow moves to the previous image as desired. 
> - Tested **Carousel indicator bar** and images caqn be selected by their position by clicking on relevant bars.
> - Tested **Send** button on Contact page withoput any text in inputs to ensure that it provides the desired error of 'Please fill out this field' to appropriate required fields.
> - Tested **Email** entry input by not entering a valid email address. This provides the desired error of 'Please include an @ in hte email address'.
> - Tested **Radio buttons** to ensure only _one option can be selected_ and that _at least one option_ is required.
> - Further testing of Responsiveness of all pages using [Google Mobile-Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly)
> - 1. [Home Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=xFabK99FmnLzZb1GxaoAQA)
> - 2. [About Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=sdaKzF2MGaSQ6f24M7x7_g)
> - 3. [Gallery Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=UhXGW2xJswuM9ZqXZIc6YQ)
> - 4. [Contact Page](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?id=0KNaDvsBA9EPBlFwkz4IKA)
> - Tested overall site colours on [a11y](https://color.a11y.com/), a Color Contrast Accessibility Validator. Test came back with excellent results.
> - Tested [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/) No errors or warnings to show.
> - Tested [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
> - 1.  Parse Error on 47 items related to CSS Variable values. Researched this and found that this is a non-issue after reading reports on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/57661659/w3c-css-validation-parse-error-on-variables) and other sources. It is a requested feature on [Github](https://github.com/w3c/css-validator/issues/111) too.
> - 2.  Warning 'Imported style sheets are not checked in direct input and file upload modes'. Confident to ignore these after researching and a common answer is that the validator will not validate imported style sheets. See [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25946111/importing-css-is-ending-up-with-an-error).
> - Tested site URL on [Website Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/) which rendered good results. Images are on the large size in PNG format and already compressed. I chose to maintain the PNG format as the image quality of the site is integral to the UX.
> - Checked grammar and spelling throughout document.
> - Ran CSS through [Autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io/) and copied new CSS code back into style.css doc.
> - Re-ran CSS Validation and 30 warnings appeared for 'unknown vendor extension'. Confident to ignore these as answered on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5271955/css-parse-errors-from-a-generated-stylesheet).
> - Ran README text through [Online-Spellcheck](https://www.online-spellcheck.com/) to double-check on grammar and spelling.

### Project barriers and solutions

> - Bootstrap carousel works fine on desktop views with landscape images, but on mobile created large white space underneath. To overcome this I started a new branch called 'Gallery-carousel'. I creatined a static gallery of images in mobile and tablet views and once tested, I then merged the branch with the master branch.
> - About Section 'cards' were aligning fine, but uneven bottom according to how much text entered in each. Overcame by researching online and finding a workable solution on Stack Overflow using Bootstrap's d-flex and flex-fill values.
> - Contact form was not being responsive on smaller laptop views. To overcome this, I included the form in a Bootstrap Grid layout.
> - Bootstrap Carousel was being cut off at the bottom and allowed no space for Gallery heading. To overcome this I wrapped the carousel in its own Bootstrap Container. Added the Gallery heading above keeping the entire site consistent.
> - Encountered an issue with Bootstrap mobile naivigation (hamburger menu) pushing content down when opened. This was further an issue on Firefox and Safari browsers, with content being pulled up and not positioned correctly when menu was collapsed again. To overcome this I started a new branch called 'Alternate-Nav-Menu' to work on an alternative. In CSS, I set the dropdown menu to `position:absolute` and adjusted width, background color and padding accordingly. However, this caused the nagivation bar to be misplaced when in desktop view (+992px). To overcome this, I added a media query of `position:relative` and `top:0px` which worked perfectly. I then merged the branch with the master branch.
